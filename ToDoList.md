1) DONE (man with sandwich)

2) DONE (man lost with a map)

3) DONE (Phéroménal)

4) DONE (man sorcerer)

5) DONE (proud farmer with a vegetable basket)

6) DONE (women in front a store glass)

7) DONE (man holding a denture)

8) DONE (cat scratching a sofa)

9) DONE (the chair desk revelation)

10) DONE (Capitalist in front of a painting)

11) DONE (Man alone in prison)

12) DONE (Monney against tin can exchange)

13) DONE (man smoking proud)

14) DONE (woman wearing virtual reality headset)

15) DONE (man tanning in front of his computer)

16) REWORK (man & woman with scratched car)
	--> The woman's hand in front of her mouth make a weird effect. I first watched the drawing on my cellphone and it was hard to understand the woman's feelings. Then I watched it on my computer : it's better but still confusing.
	--> I think it could be better if her hands were in this position (instead of crossed) :

17) DONE (Scene shown from smartphone)

18) REWORK (the 3 toilet doors)
	--> I would like the capitalist mustach to be more like this one (a very clean one, similar to the monopoly man) :
	![image URL](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/retro-cartoon-mustache-vector-260nw-1041893125.jpg)
	--> The capitalist has no drawn mouth. His mustache is used for his feelings : if he's happy, the mustach is turned up and down he's sad.
	--> The dollar pictogram seems to be misplaced, but indeed you placed it right the first time and we did not see it well. So I imagined another pictogram which can be a bit hidden by the capitalist head but still understandable : a man pictogram, similar to the one you already drew but holding dollar bills in his hands.
	--> On this image, the position is similar to the last pictogram :

19) REWORK (sea weed tamer)
	--> The man's arm holding the whip feels unnatural : you would never raise your arm this way while using a whip. I would like him to have his arm more forward (and not full extended).
	--> Let's add this effect at the whip end :
	![image URL](https://www.stickpng.com/fr/img/objets/fouets/fouet-qui-claque)

20) DONE (saint manager)

21) REWORK (Opened wallet)
	--> It's better, but it looks like a part of a jeans with its pockets.
	--> Maybe, to fold a bit the wallet would help to understand better.

22) DONE (prison cell with 2 characters)

23) DONE (the medium cheating)

24) DONE (cat for vilains)

25) REWORK (The cannabis birthday cake)
	--> The scene is good but the children seems to be looking somewhere else. Even if her eyes are closed, the girl should be focused on the cake.

26) REWORK (The capitalist writing on a music sheet)
	--> Similar to the 18) : let's change the mustach and use it as if the mustach itself was his mouth (telling his feelings). In this case, as if he was smiling.

27) DONE (strawberry on a coffin)

28) REWORK (man in a hammoc)
	--> The first pilar (the one to the left) is not straight. It gives the feeling it will fall soon.

29) DONE (man with cigar box)

30) REWORK (old man on a bench in a park)
	--> The man's body direction should be turned to the pigeons. The whole position seems strange if his head is turned in a direction and his body into another.
	--> The phone wire must be to the right (not the left). It does not leave the scene from behind but from the right.
	--> I found a picture for illustrate what I imagine :
	![image URL](https://images.cdn2.stockunlimited.net/preview1300/businesswoman-pulling-telephone-receiver_1704076.jpg)

	--> Except the old man is not pulling hard on the wire/cable/receiver (I dont know the correct word for this) and it does not leave from the left but the right.
	--> The old man is talking, his mouth should be a bit more opened. I think he looked angry the first time because of his mouth orientation (down) and his eyebrows.

31) DONE (characters in manga style)

32) DONE (the baby with a briefcase)

33) REWORK (the radar with sunglasses)
	--> I actualy prefered the first one but we do not understand it's a radar...
	--> Let's remove the two squares behind the sunglasses / move a bit to the bottom the label and the target (in order to the mouth to not be in contact with the label)
	--> The hat is not fitting as well on this new radar. Maybe if it (the hat) was bigger it would fit better ? Or removing the black and white stripes on the radar sides. I let you chose what suits better.

34) DONE (man drinking a coffee)

35) DONE (capitalist mariage)

36) REWORK (vault boy with a laptop)
	--> It's hard to tell it's a laptop (but you add the apple logo to help)
	--> Maybe drawing the laptop bigger (I think it's not the current size of a real laptop)
	--> Or if you think it would be better : the man can hold the laptop opened, oriented to him, on his forearm (this position)
	![image URL](https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/laptop-holding-positions.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1600&h=900&crop=1)

37) DONE (the foodtruck ads)

38) DONE (the bad taste orange juice)

39) DONE (the book of knowledge)

40) REWORK
	--> I would like to change this whole scene. It does not render good (not your fault, the idea itself may not be great)
	--> Similar to this link :
	![image URL](https://www.google.fr/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fw0.pngwave.com%2Fpng%2F1012%2F213%2Fkid-flash-wally-west-robin-teen-titans-flash-png-clip-art.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pngwave.com%2Fpng-clip-art-vnxvw&tbnid=8nuD8-pWDSuX9M&vet=12ahUKEwiAxdKA_6jpAhWL04UKHdsUBzkQMygkegQIARBY..i&docid=o5sPqeFjs6L_8M&w=910&h=512&q=flash%20cartoon&ved=2ahUKEwiAxdKA_6jpAhWL04UKHdsUBzkQMygkegQIARBY)

	--> The man dressed as the hero "Flash" is running fast
	--> Only one catchphrase at the top : "Pour le meilleur de vous-même, la meilleure des connexions" (no banner, font and color as usual for catchphrase)

41) DONE (man in the bumping car)

42) REWORK (man opening an horror box)
	--> The spider web was a good idea but it 'behavior' seems strange : it looks like it has been put there and not included into the scene. It should probably not be facing the viewer or should be a little torn.
	--> You can either modify the spider web or remove it, as you wish.

43) DONE (man dressed as hospital patient)

44) DONE (man tearing a contract)

45) DONE (man with a staff t-shirt)

46) REWORK (the man stucked into a slide)
	--> It's hard to tell it's a slide. I think two details can change this :
	--> Adding some circular joints. On closed slide there are often circular pieces joining the different parts of the slide.
	--> Reducing the slope's angle. No need for the slide to be that steep.
	--> I imagined the man stucked to be oriented belly on the ground and more big (the size can be bigger than the slide pipe. The main goal is to have a comical effect similar to a looney tunes cartoons where the characters are often trapped into things smaller than they are).
	--> I would like the "restaurant" writing to be closer to the product name


47) REWORK (the plumber)
	--> It gives the impression the man is not laying on the back but standing up.
	--> I did not find a link for showing an example. If this position is too hard to draw, maybe we can try another :
	![image URL](https://www.google.fr/search?q=plumber+cartoon&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjjlob0hKnpAhUKahoKHdUzCTUQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=plumber+cartoon&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB4yBAgAEB46BAgAEENQ_KQBWPDAAWChwgFoAnAAeAGAAcYDiAHUD5IBCjE0LjAuMS4wLjKYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img&ei=2NC3XuPKNorUadXnpKgD&bih=937&biw=1903&rlz=1C2CHBF_frFR792FR792&hl=fr#imgrc=7cx7MK1Kt7yNCM&imgdii=U0Kk-20cS2vQzM)

	--> The same pose : the man kneeled in front of a pipe, fixing it with one hand and a tool.
	--> With his other hand, in the background, he's hitting on the pipe (or the bathroom sink) and water is flooding out of it.
	--> Still no writing needed

48) DONE (man looking at a mathematic board)

49) DONE (exchange monney against form)

50) DONE (wizard shop keeper)

51) TO DO
	--> Scene : front
	--> The capitalist is behind a casino table as a casino dealer. They are many tokens on the table on his left and right.
	--> The capitalist seems to be inviting the viewer to play.
	--> I imagine this pose for the capitalist :
	![image URL](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/028/459/cover2.jpg)

	--> Only one catchphrase at the top : "N'ayez pas les jetons de gagner des jetons"

52) DONE (3 characters in prison cell)

53) DONE (woman with shopping bags)

54) REWORK (terminator in opened plan)
	--> There is a typo : should be "Connor" instead of "Cnnor"
	--> The robot seems affraid or stressed. He should be borred/tired.
	--> I found this example of this feeling (the link is long) :
	![image URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shubham8550/Test_Repo/master/download.png)

55) DONE (the panda portrait)

56) DONE (the caricatural french)

57) DONE (the rich governess)

58) DONE (the sailor)

59) REWORK (the capitalist elixir)
	---> The drawing is perfect but I would like the writing and the capitalist circle to be bigger and be more at the top (it will leave a margin between the writing and the bottle).

60) TO DO
	--> The scene : from the top
	--> The man, dressed as a RPG warrior (a sword and an armor) is looking at the viewer.
	--> The point of view is particular : we see the scene as if we were a giant creature, looking at the man from above.
	--> The man is looking up at the viewer. The man is smiling nervously. I found this image as exemple of nervous smile :
	![image URL](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1f/b3/c2/1fb3c2ea8ab37bb890e31bbc1dc47b9d.png)

	--> A big humanoid shadow is upon the man.
	--> The catchphrase : "Donnez à vos aventures une autre dimension"
	--> The product name : "VRPG" (not with an hand writen font)

61) TO DO
	--> The scene : front
	--> A teddy bear, dressed as the monopoly man : a hat, a cane, a mustache, a suit.
	--> He has no pants and a round belly. His two ears are on both side of the hat.
	--> His pose is the same as in this portrait :
	![image URL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg)

	--> Since a cartoon teddy bear and a real human portrait has not the same proportions at all, you can re-arrange the details of the pose (I dont think the teddy can have the same pose with his legs for example)
	--> Still, his face stays cute. He can be smiling but not with an opened mouth then.

62) TO DO
	--> The scene : side
	--> As the scene were Newton is sitting under an apple tree, here the capitalist is sitting under a tree were the fruits are dollar bills.
	--> I found this image :
	![image URL](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/4917/6438/products/isaac-newton-collection-007_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1549226092)

	--> The scene is the same as the image. But the character is the capitalist.
	--> A dollar bill is falling for the tree to the head of the capitalist (but does not touch him yet, it just takes the direction)
	--> The dollar bill is not falling straight as an apple would. It falling as a leaf (with a right and left movement)
	--> No writing needed

63) TO DO
	--> The scene : side
	--> Same position as this scene :
	![image URL](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/51/2d/62/512d62ba4c0a007c8e008d17f9077ea4.jpg)

	--> The capitalist is swinging as spiderman but he has no super hero costume (dressed as usual)
	--> The spider thread is the same as the image.
	--> The position is same except for one detail : the capitalist is not doing the spiderman's hand sign with his free hand. Instead, the capitalist is holding his hat as if it was going to fall because of the movement speed.
	--> Behind him, the capitalist is leaving a trail of dollar bill, as if he was losing monney while swinging (similar idea to the scene with the baby and the briefcase)
	--> The capitalist seems happy and excited, as if he was doing this for the first time and find it amazing.
	--> No writing needed

64) TO DO
	--> The scene : similar to the 50) (the wizard shopkeeper)
	--> Instead of a wizard shop, the shop is a post apocalyptic one.
	--> The shopkeeper is still the man but with a gas mask and a bulletproof vest.
	--> The product behind him are according to the new theme. We can find : survival rations in tin cans, first aid kits, gas mask, a baseball bat with barbed wires (a reference to the walking dead series), jerrycans, ropes, backpack, battery, trecking boots, flashlight, bulletproof vest.
	--> I quoted as many items as you included in the previous scene so you can draw a similar scene.

65) TO DO
	--> The scene : similar to the 12) and 49) (the exchange with a tin can or a form)
	--> Instead of an exchange, there is an handshake
	--> The hand in front is old. The one in background is not.
